# srppp - R package to read XML dumps of the Swiss Register of Plant Protection Products

## Description

Functions to generate data objects from XML versions of the Swiss
Register of Plant Protection Products (SRPPP). An online version of the
register can be accessed at <https://www.psm.admin.ch/de/produkte>.
There is no guarantee of correspondence of the data read in using this
package with that online version, or with the original registration
documents. Also, the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office,
coordinating the authorisation of plant protection products in
Switzerland, does not answer requests regarding this package.

## Installation from CRAN
